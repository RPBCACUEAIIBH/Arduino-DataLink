- Make sure DataLink is uninstalled then run the Testrun.sh script...
- If the Testrun.sh doesn't finish, DataLink will remain installed. (that is not good, you always want to run the version you've made changes to...) so run the install.sh to uninstall it...
- Testing is mostly manual, but accelerated by not having to install it, the one liner command runs on it's own then it asks if you wanna continue with on the fly testing...
- During the on the fly testing 3 new terminals will launch, 1 for monitoring the Controls file in real time, the other 2 for typing commands directly to the Output files(that goes to the arduino) and the Controls(for the DataLink)...
- Type help for command list and description...
