This is kind of an all in onne dev tool... You can test your code with it, as well as a modified DataLink(it makes sure you always use the latest by re-installing it every time you run this tool.), and it provides an example on how to interact with it in your own code(independent of programming language, you only need to launch it and write files.)...

- Upload the provided sketch to your arduino, and launch the Testrun.sh script.
- The one liner command runs on it's own first, then it asks if you wanna continue with on the fly testing...(Comment it out if you don't need it.)
- During the on the fly testing it launches 3 new terminals, 1 for monitoring the Controls file in real time, the other 2 for typing commands directly to the Output files(that goes to the arduino) and the Controls(for the DataLink)...
- Type help for command list and description...
- The InputTerm and OutputTerm.sh is only for easy manual control. If your looking for an example how to interface it, you can find that out from the Testrun.sh, and by running it, and typing help in the control terminal. Probably the only other thing you may need from the InputTerm.sh is the example on how to auto-reload the config in case you need the ability to change baud rate on the fly.(First if in the while loop.).
